Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, 
but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

Here are some benefits of making a website accessible: 

Ethical: It's the right thing to do
Broader reach: Increases audience size
Legal: Avoids the risk of lawsuits
SEO: Boosts search engine ranking
Demographic: Aging population wants access
User experience: Better experience for all users


Here are some ways to make a website more accessible: 

Add images with alt text
Allow users to enlarge font sizes
Keep contrast sensitivity in mind
Add keyboard navigation
Make video and multimedia accessible
Use descriptive URLs
Use ARIA roles
